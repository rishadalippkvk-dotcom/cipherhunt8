### Account Management:
✅ **DO**:
- Disable accounts before deleting (for investigation)

- Delete active game sessions arbitrarily

### User Communication:
- Notify users before disabling accounts
- Provide contact information for appeals
- Document disabled account policies
- Set clear reactivation procedures

## 📈 Statistics & Monitoring

### Monitoring:
- Track disabled account trends

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
