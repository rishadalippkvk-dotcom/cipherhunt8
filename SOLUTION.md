# 🔧 Solution for Backend Connection Error

## 📋 Problem
You were seeing this error:
```
❌ Error loading questions: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=8000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/auth/questions/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x000001E2E89DD7B0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it'))
```

## ✅ Root Cause
The Django backend server was not running when the Streamlit frontend tried to connect to it at `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
The frontend code was already updated to:
- Gracefully handle connection errors to the backend
- Provide clear warning messages when the backend is unavailable
- Automatically fall back to local storage and hardcoded questions
- Continue functioning with limited features when the backend is down

### 2. Started the Backend Server
The Django backend server has now been successfully started on port 8000.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application Properly

### Option 1: Manual Start (Recommended)
1. **Start the Django backend server:**
   ```powershell
   # Open PowerShell as Administrator
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\traessure hunt\backend"
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Start the Streamlit frontend (in a new PowerShell window):**
   ```powershell
   # Open another PowerShell window
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\traessure hunt"
   streamlit run final2.py
   ```

### Option 2: Using PowerShell Scripts
If the PowerShell scripts work on your system:

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\traessure hunt"
   .\start_backend.ps1
   ```

2. **Start the frontend (in a new PowerShell window):**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\traessure hunt"
   .\start_frontend.ps1
   ```

## 🔄 What Was Fixed
1. **Backend Server**: The Django backend server is now running on port 8000
2. **API Endpoint**: The `/api/auth/questions/` endpoint is accessible and returning data
3. **Connection**: The frontend can now successfully connect to the backend

## 📝 Verification
The backend is now working correctly:
- Questions are being loaded from the database
- All API endpoints are accessible
- Full authentication and progress saving features are available

## 🌐 Access the Application
- **Game Interface:** http://localhost:8501
- **Admin Panel:** http://localhost:8000/admin
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123

## ❗ Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Execution Policy Error
If you see this error when trying to run PowerShell scripts:
```
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```

**Solution:**
Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### 2. Path Issues
If you get "file not found" errors, make sure you're in the correct directory:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\DELL\Desktop\traessure hunt\backend"
```

### 3. Port Already in Use
If port 8000 is already in use:
```powershell
python manage.py runserver 8001
```
Then update the API_BASE_URL in final2.py to `http://localhost:8001/api/auth`

## 🎯 Features Now Available
With the backend running, you have access to:
- **Full Game:** 6 levels of FOSS riddles loaded from database
- **User Authentication:** Register and login with persistent accounts
- **Progress Tracking:** Save and load game progress
- **Achievements:** Unlock badges as you play
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage questions and users
- **Leaderboard:** Compete with other players

## 🛡️ Fallback Mode
When the backend is not available, the application will:
- Use local JSON file for user authentication
- Load questions from hardcoded data
- Save progress locally
- Continue with limited functionality

For full features, always run both backend and frontend servers.
